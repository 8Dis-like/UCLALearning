    "# PSET 2 Step-by-Step Guide for Turning Business Scenarios into SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal of this guide is to help you approach each scenario, identify the necessary SQL commands, and solve the problems step by step using the `mysql-connector-python` library. The aim is to bridge the gap between the business problem and the SQL queries required to derive insights.\n",

    "## Scenario 1: Budget Optimization in School Districts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "A school district is facing budget constraints and wants to ensure it is allocating salaries effectively without compromising the quality of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze salary distribution:** Identify districts with the highest and lowest average teacher salaries.\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average salary for each district, and `GROUP BY` to group the results by district. Use `ORDER BY` to sort the results in descending and ascending order to find the highest and lowest average salaries.\n",
    "   - **SQL Keywords:** `SELECT`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`\n",
    "   - **Python Example for Executing an SQL Command:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Connect to the MySQL database\n",
    "     mydb = mysql.connector.connect(user='your_username', password='your_password',\n",
    "                                   host='localhost', database='your_database')\n",
    "     cursor = mydb.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Example query (generic, not solving the problem)\n",
    "     query = \"SELECT column_name FROM your_table WHERE some_condition;\"\n",
    "     cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Fetch the results\n",
    "     results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "     for row in results:\n",
    "         print(row)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experience vs. Salary:** Investigate whether there is a relationship between teacher salaries and years of experience across different districts.\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Group the data by `experience_total` and calculate the average salary for each experience level. You can also include district information if needed.\n",
    "   - **SQL Keywords:** `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `AVG()`, `ORDER BY`\n",
    "   - **Python Example for Executing an SQL Command:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Example query for calculating average values (generic)\n",
    "     query = \"SELECT some_column, AVG(another_column) FROM your_table GROUP BY some_column;\"\n",
    "     cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Fetch and display results\n",
    "     results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "     for row in results:\n",
    "         print(row)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendations:** Based on your analysis, suggest salary adjustments to optimize budget allocation.\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Use the results from tasks 1 and 2 to provide insights. For example, if there is a significant disparity in average salaries across districts, suggest adjustments for lower-paying districts to retain talent.\n",

    "## Scenario 2: Retention of High-Performing Teachers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Salary and Experience Analysis:** Analyze how salary correlates with teacher experience in your county compared to neighboring counties.\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Use a `WHERE` clause to filter data for your county (e.g., `WHERE county = 'Passaic'`) and neighboring counties, then group by `experience_total` to analyze average salaries.\n",
    "   - **SQL Keywords:** `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`\n",
    "   - **Python Example for Executing an SQL Command:**\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retention Strategy:** Identify salary thresholds for teachers with more than 10 years of experience to determine if salary increases could help retain them.\n",
    "   - **Hint:** Use a `WHERE` clause to filter teachers with `experience_total > 10`, and calculate the average salary.\n",
    "   - **SQL Keywords:** `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`\n",
    "   - **Python Example for Executing an SQL Command:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",

    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Certification Impact:** Analyze salary differences between certified and non-certified teachers.\n",
