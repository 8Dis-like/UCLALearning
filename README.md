# UCLALearning
This is a repository collecting my implementation of different tasks during my learning at UCLA, including but not limited to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning.

Resources come from Machine Learning (CM146), Deep Learning (ECE C147/247), Reinforcement Learning (CS260R), Kinematics of Robots (MECH&AE C263A), and Data and Business Analysis (ENG213). Typically, they can be respectively well distinguished by file names.

However, for some projects or tasks situated at the intersection of many courses or topics, the relevant files are organized in a combined style spanning objective-oriented programming(OOP) and software engineering.

Some of the files are directly derived from platforms and communities such as Google Colab, PyCharm, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and, of course, GitHub.

Up till now, most of the files are classified as Python/Jupyter Notebook, which indicates a certain commonality and advantages. But resources aren't necessarily ubiquitous, while they indeed share different purposes
